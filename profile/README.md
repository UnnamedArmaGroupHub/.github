### Unnamed Arma Group

#### Make memes, not war.

Unnamed Arma Group is a community dedicated to hosting "seriously fun" sessions for the Armed Assault (Arma) series of games. We specifically focus on small team tactics where each member is a vital part of the team and not just a grunt. You'll also find that we have a relaxed atmosphere, with no "yes sir, no sir" bullshit to deal with.

We're currently in the process of getting everything set up again after a long hiatus from the game. If you're interested in joining us, please join our Discord server below, grab the Arma 3 role, and say hello!
